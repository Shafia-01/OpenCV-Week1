# OpenCV Applications - Research Summaries

This document explores practical use cases of OpenCV across multiple domains.  
Each section includes a short description and references for further study.

## 1. Robotics: Visual SLAM
OpenCV provides feature detection (ORB, SIFT, FAST) and geometric transforms that power SLAM, allowing robots to map environments and localize themselves.

## 2. Medical Imaging: Preprocessing & Segmentation
Used to enhance diagnostic images (MRI, CT, X-ray) by denoising, segmenting, and improving contrast before ML/DL analysis.

## 3. Autonomous Vehicles: Lane & Object Detection
Lane detection implemented with Canny + Hough Transform; object detection via `cv2.dnn` with YOLO/SSD models.

## 4. Surveillance: Motion Detection & Tracking
Background subtraction (`cv2.createBackgroundSubtractorMOG2`) enables moving-object detection, combined with trackers (KCF, CSRT) for CCTV analytics.

## 5. Augmented Reality: Pose Estimation
`cv2.solvePnP` and ArUco marker detection compute camera pose for overlaying 3D virtual objects in real-world video.

## 6. Industrial Automation: Defect Detection
OpenCV enables visual inspection in manufacturing (cracks, scratches, misalignments) using contour analysis, edge detection, and template matching.

## 7. Face Recognition & Biometrics
Haar cascades detect faces; LBPH or embeddings provide recognition. Used in attendance, surveillance, and authentication systems.

## 8. Sports Analytics: Player & Ball Tracking
Contours, optical flow, and object trackers analyze player positions and ball trajectories for performance analysis.

## 9. Document Processing: OCR Preprocessing
OpenCV improves OCR accuracy by deskewing, binarization, noise removal, and detecting text contours before Tesseract OCR.

## 10. Agriculture: Crop & Disease Monitoring
Drone or field images analyzed with OpenCV to detect crop health issues (leaf spots, discoloration) for precision farming.
