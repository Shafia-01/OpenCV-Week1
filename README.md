## ⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shafia-01/OpenCV-Week1.git
cd OpenCV-Week1
```

(Optional) create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage
Run any script from the `exercises/` folder. Example:
```bash
python exercises/assignment1_basics.py
```
- Input files should be placed in the `images/` folder.
- Processed results will be shown in OpenCV windows or saved to the `outputs/` folder.
- Press any key to close OpenCV display windows.

## 📌 Contents
- Exercises: Python scripts for basics, filtering, edges, thresholding, and OS-specific testing.
- Notes: Markdown files with image processing concepts and OpenCV module details.
- Research: Markdown files with OpenCV applications and platform differences.
- Images/Outputs: Demo inputs and results.
- Report: Comprehensive report.
